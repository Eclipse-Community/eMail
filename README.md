Repo for Eclipse Mail and Lun3r Navigator if I ever make it.

Eclipse Mail is a fork of Interlink Mail and News, or UXP Thunderbird made for Windows XP and IA-32 i686 processors. Some advantages over roytam1's mailnews are more optimzations and better interoperability with upstream. (using SQL storage intead of DBM)

Lun3r Navigator will likely be the same as above if I make it.
